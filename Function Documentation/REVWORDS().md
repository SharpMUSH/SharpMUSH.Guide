# REVWORDS()
`revwords(<list>[, <delimiter>[, <output separator>]])`

  This function reverses the order of words in a list. List elements are separated by `<delimiter>`, which defaults to a space. Elements in the reversed list are separated by `<ouput separator>`, which defaults to the delimiter.

You say, "eep baz bar foo"
```
