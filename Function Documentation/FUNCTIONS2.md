# FUNCTIONS2
  There are two types of functions, "built-in functions" and "global user functions", also known as "@functions". You can get a complete list of functions on this game with "@list/functions".

  Built-in functions are written in the game hardcode, while @functions are written in softcode, and then made global with the "@function" command. Both are used in exactly the same manner. For more information on @functions, see [@function].
