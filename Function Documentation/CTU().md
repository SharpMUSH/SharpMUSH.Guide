# CTU()
`ctu(<angle>, <from>, <to>)`

  Converts between the different ways to measure angles. `<from>` controls what the angle is treated as, and `<to>` what form it is turned into. See HELP ANGLES for more information.

  Example:
```
say 90 degrees is [ctu(90, d, r)] radians
You say, "90 degrees is 1.570796 radians"
```
