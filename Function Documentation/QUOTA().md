# QUOTA()
`quota(<player>)`

  Returns the player's quota, the maximum number of objects they can create if quotas are in effect. Returns 99999 for players with the No_Quota @power, so it's safe to use in numerical comparisons.

  You must control `<player>` or have the See_All or Quotas @powers to use this function.
