# Bitwise functions
  These functions treat integers as a sequence of binary bits (either 0 or 1) and manipulate them.

  For example, 2 is represented as '0010' and 4 as '0100'. If these two numbers are bitwise-or'ed together with BOR(), the result is 6, or (in binary) '0110'. These functions are useful for storing small lists of toggle (Yes/No) options efficiently.
