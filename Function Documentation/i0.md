# %i0
`ilev()`
`itext(<n>)`
  %i`<n>`
`inum(<n>)`

  These functions return the equivilent of ## (itext) or #@ (inum) for iter() and @dolist, where an `<n>`=0 returns to the current iter or @dolist, `<n>`=1 refers to the iter()/@dolist which the current iter() or @dolist is nested in, etc. An `<n>` of "L" can be used to refer to the outermost iter()/@dolist. %i`<n>` is an alias for itext(`<n>`), where `<n>` can be from 0 to 9 (or "L").

  ilev() returns the current nesting depth, or -1 when used outside an iter() or @dolist. Thus, itext(ilev()) will return the outermost ##, equivilent to %iL.

  See [itext2] for examples.
