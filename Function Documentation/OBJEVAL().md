# OBJEVAL()
`objeval(<object>, <expression>)`

  Allows you to evaluate `<expression>` from the viewpoint of `<object>`. If side-effect functions are enabled, you must control `<object>`; if not, you must either control `<object>` or have the see_all power. If `<object>` does not exist or you don't meet one of the criterion, the expression evaluates with your privileges.
