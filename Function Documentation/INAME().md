# INAME()
`iname(<object>)`

  iname() returns the name of `<object>`, as it would appear if you were inside it. It is identical to name() except that if the object has a NAMEFORMAT or NAMEACCENT attribute, it is used.

  You must be see_all, control `<object>`, or be inside it to use this function.
