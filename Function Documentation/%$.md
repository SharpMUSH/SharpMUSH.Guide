`slev()`
`stext([<n>])`
  %$`<n>`

  slev() returns the current nesting depth of switch*(), reswitch*() and @switch/@selects. stext() returns the `<string>` being matched for the current switch, or the `<n>`th switch where n=0 is the current switch, n=1 is the switch the current switch is nested in, and so on. It is a safer replacement for the "#$" token, which (because it is replaced before evaluation) is unsafe with user input, and unsuitable for use in nested switches.

  stext(L) returns the `<string>` for the outermost switch, and is equivilent to stext(slev()). %$`<n>` is equivilent to stext(`<n>`), for `<n>`s of 0-9 or L.

  Examples:
```
&cmd.whois me=$whois *: @pemit %#=switch(pmatch(%0),#-*, I don't know '%0', '%0' is %$0)
@switch foo=f*, say switch(bar, b*,%$1 %$0!)
You say, "foo bar!"
```
