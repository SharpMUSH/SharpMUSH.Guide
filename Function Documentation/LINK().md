# LINK()
`link(<object>, <destination>[, <preserve>])`

  This function links `<object>` to `<destination>`. While normally used on exits, it has all of the other capabilities of @link as well. It returns #-1 or 0 on failure, 1 on success. If the optional third argument is true, acts like @link/preserve.
