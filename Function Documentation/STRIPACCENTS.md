# STRIPACCENTS()
`stripaccents(<string>[, <smart>])`

  Returns the string with accented characters converted to non-accented. As with the accent() function, this assumes the ISO 8859-1 character set.

 If the second argument is true, it does more a intelligent conversion that might result in one character being turned into several. When it's false, or not given, one character in the input string corresponds to one character in the result.
