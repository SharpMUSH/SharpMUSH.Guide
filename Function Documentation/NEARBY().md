# NEARBY()
`nearby(<object 1>, <object 2>)`

  Returns 1 if `<object 1>` is "nearby" `<object 2>`, and 0 otherwise. "Nearby" means the objects are in the same location, or that one is located inside the other. You must control at least one of the objects; if you don't, or if one of the objects can't be found, nearby() returns #-1.
