# ATAN()
# ATAN2()
`atan(<tangent>[, <angle type>])`
`atan2(<number1>, <number2>[, <angle type>])`

  Returns the angle with the given `<tangent>` (arc-tangent), with the angle expressed in the given `<angle type>`, or radians by default.

  atan2(x, y) is like atan(fdiv(x, y)), except y can be 0, and the signs of both arguments are used in determining the sign of the result. It is useful in converting between cartesian and polar coordinates.

  See 'HELP ANGLES' for more on the angle type.
