# CSECS()
`ctime(<object>[, <utc>])`
`csecs(<object>)`

  ctime() returns the date and time that `<object>` was created. The time returned is in the server's local timezone, unless `<utc>` is true, in which case the time is in the UTC timezone.

  csecs() returns the time as the number of seconds since the epoch. Anyone can get the creation time of any object in the game.
