# Boolean functions
  Boolean functions all return 0 or 1 as an answer.

  Your MUSH may be configured to use traditional PennMUSH booleans, in which case non-zero numbers, non-negative db#'s, and strings are all considered "true" when passed to these functions. Alternatively, your MUSH may be using TinyMUSH 2.2 booleans, in which case only non-zero numbers are "true". Check @config tiny_booleans.
