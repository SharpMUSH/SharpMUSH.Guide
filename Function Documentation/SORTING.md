# SORTING
  In functions where you can specify a sorting method, you can provide one of these sort types:

  Type    Sorts:<br>
   a       Sorts lexicographically (Maybe case-sensitive).<br>
   i       Sorts lexicographically (Always case-insensitive).<br>
   d       Sorts dbrefs.<br>
   n       Sorts integer numbers.<br>
   f       Sorts decimal numbers.<br>
   m       Sorts strings with embedded numbers and dbrefs (as names).<br>
   name    Sorts dbrefs by their names. (Maybe case-sensitive)<br>
   namei   Sorts dbrefs by their names. (Always case-insensitive)<br>
   conn    Sorts dbrefs by their connection time.<br>
   idle    Sorts dbrefs by their idle time.<br>
   owner   Sorts dbrefs by their owner dbrefs.<br>
   loc     Sorts dbrefs by their location dbref.<br>
   ctime   Sorts dbrefs by their creation time.<br>
   mtime   Sorts dbrefs by their modification time.<br>
   lattr   Sorts attribute names.

  The special sort key attr:`<aname>` or attri:`<aname>` will sort dbrefs according to their `<aname>` attributes. For example: Separating by &factions or &species attrs. attr is probably case-sensitive, and attri is case-insensitive.

  Prefixing the sort type with a minus sign, -, reverses the order of the sort.

  Whether or not the 'a' sort type is case-sensitive or not depends on the particular mush and its environment.
