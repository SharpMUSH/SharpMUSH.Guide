# OR()
# COR()
`or(<boolean1>, <boolean2>[, ... , <booleanN>])`
`cor(<boolean1>, <boolean2>[, ... , <booleanN>])`

  These functions take a number of boolean values, and return 1 if any of them are true, and 0 if all are false. or() always evaluates all of its arguments, while cor() stops evaluating as soon as one is true.
