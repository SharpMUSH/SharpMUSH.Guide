# What is MUSH?

Wikipedia: MUSH historically has stood for various terms, like Multi-User Shared Hallucination, Multi-User Shared Habitat, and Multi-User Shared Hack. It is a type of text-based online game that allows multiple players to interact with each other and the game world in real-time. MUSHes are typically built around a shared virtual environment where players can create characters, explore, and engage in role-playing activities. They are often characterized by their emphasis on storytelling, character development, and social interaction.

In general, MUSHes are a type of MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) that focuses on social interaction and role-playing rather than in-gamecombat and exploration, though there are those that buck this trend.

This differs from Forum Roleplay or Disord / Chatroom Roleplay in that the game is live and real-time, with players interacting with each other and the game world in real-time, in a world with rooms and exits, where players can explore and interact with the environment.

What’s more, most MUSHes contain special commands to enhance the way players can interact with the game world, such as look, go, and so on.

Each connection to the game is a Character, and each Character bears attributes, descriptions, and other information that can be used to enhance the game experience. What’s more, there’s a whole world to travel through, using ‘Rooms’ and ‘Exits’ to go from place to place to get together and roleplay.

MUSHes also provide tools such as @mail, pages (whispers) and channels, allowing for easy of communication between players on game-wide scale, and the ability to send more private messages to other players, even if they are not online at the same time.
