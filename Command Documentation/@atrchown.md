`@atrchown <object>/<attribute>=<new owner>`

This command changes the ownership of the attribute `<attribute>` on `<object>` to `<new owner>`. You can only @atrchown attributes which you can set. Wizards can @atrchown to any player, while mortals can only @atrchown attributes to themselves. Only players can own attributes; if `<new owner>` is not a player, `<new owner>`'s owner is used instead.
