# @warnings2
Example 1: Normal building situations
Most people will simply want to leave their @warnings set to "normal" and their objects' @warnings set to "none". They will then receive normal warnings for all their objects.

Example 2: Warning-lover
People who find warnings very helpful (like heavy builders) may want to set their personal @warnings to "extra" or "all", and keep their objects' warnings at "none". If a specific object should be treated less strictly, set that object's @warnings differently. If an object shouldn't be warned on at all, set the NO_WARN flag on the object.

See [@warnings3].
