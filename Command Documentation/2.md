# ]2
Using ']' with $-commands:

```
> &test Tester=$test *: @pemit %#=I got: %0
```

Normal evaluation:
```
> test My name is %n.
I got: My name is Wiggles.
```

Preventing the user input from being evaluated:
```
> ]test My name is %n.
I got: My name is %n.
```

Preventing evaluation of code inside the $-command:
```
> &test Tester=$test *: ]@pemit %#=I got: %0
> test My name is %n.
I got: %0
```

In the last example, '%0' would evaluate to 'My name is Wiggles.' (because the string entered by the user was evaluated), but the @pemit has been told not to evaluate its arguments.
