# @warnings3
Example 3: Warning-hater
People who prefer not to be warned except for specific object may set their personal @warnings to "none" and set the @warnings on those objects to appropriate levels.

Example 4: I need some peace!
Players who @set themselves NO_WARN will receive no warnings ever until they unset the flag.
