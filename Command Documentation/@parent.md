# @parent
`@parent <object>[=<parent>]`

This command sets the parent of `<object>` to `<parent>`. If no `<parent>` is given, or `<parent>` is "none", `<object>`'s parent is cleared. You must control `<object>`, and must either control `<parent>` or it must be set LINK_OK and you must pass its @lock/parent.
