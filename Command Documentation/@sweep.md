# @sweep
`@sweep [connected | here | inventory | exits ]`

@sweep gives you a list of all nearby objects that are listening, including the room you are in and the objects you are carrying. Most objects only listen for a particular string or phrase, so they normally do not pose a problem if you need privacy. You will have to be careful of players and puppets since they will hear everything you say and do. (And might post the same to r.g.m!) AUDIBLE exits are also shown on an ordinary sweep, if the room is also AUDIBLE. (Audible exits aren't active unless the room is audible).

The four command options can also be used as switches (i.e., you can use "`@sweep/connected`" instead of "`@sweep connected`"). If the connected flag is given, only connected players and puppets owned by connected players will be shown in the @sweep. The "here" and "inventory" flags check only your location or inventory, respectively. "exits" only checks for AUDIBLE exits.
