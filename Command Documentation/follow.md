# follow
`follow <object>`

If you pass the object's follow lock, you begin following it. As the object moves around (except if it @teleports away or goes home), you will automatically move around with it, so long as you pass all the locks and enter/leave locks on the exits and things the object moves through. This doesn't prevent you from going somewhere else on your own.
