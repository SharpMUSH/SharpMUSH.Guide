# leave
`leave`

The command leave allows you to exit an object you have enter'ed into. When you leave an object, its @leave/@oleave/@oxleave messages are triggered, and its @aleave actions are triggered.

The NO_LEAVE flag may be enabled on some MUSHes. Objects set with this flag cannot be left. @lock/leave may also be enabled on some MUSHes, which allows you to set who can leave the object. If you fail to leave, the object's @lfail/@olfail/@alfail messages/actions will be triggered.
