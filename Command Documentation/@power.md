# @power
`@power/list [<power name pattern>]`
`@power <power>`
`@power <object>=[!]<power>`

`@power/list` lists the defined powers (see [powers]). A list of standard powers with explanations is given in [powers list]. When given a power name as an argument, @power displays information
about a power.

The third form manipulates powers on objects, and is limited to Wizards. `@power <object>=[!]<power>` sets (or clears) the given power on an object.

God can add, delete, and otherwise manipulate power definitions. See help @power2 for these commands.
