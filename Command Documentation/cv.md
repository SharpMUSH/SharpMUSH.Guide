# cv
`cd <name> <password>`
`ch <name> <password>`
`cv <name> <password>`

Not really MUSH commands, but commands available at the connect screen. Wizards can use 'cd' instead of 'connect'; the new connection will be hidden (as per @hide), and the player will be set DARK. Mortals set HEAR_CONNECT will not hear dark wizards connect.

Wizards, Royalty, and those with the Hide @power can use 'ch' to connect with the new connection hidden (as per @hide).

Connecting using 'cv' causes the Dark flag to be cleared prior to connection messages being broadcast.

None of those commands affect the hidden status of other connections, if you're reconnecting.
