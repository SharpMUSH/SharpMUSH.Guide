# @attribute
`@attribute <attrib>`

The @attribute command displays and modifies the MUSH's standard attributes (see "@list/attribs" for a list of them).

Since 1.8.5p1, changes to the attribute table are saved across reboots and shutdowns, and don't need to be placed in an @startup.

The first form of the command displays the full name of the attribute `<attrib>`, along with the its attribute flags, and the dbref of the object which added it to the attribute table.

See [@attribute2].
