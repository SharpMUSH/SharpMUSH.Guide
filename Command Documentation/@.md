# @_
`&<attr> <object>[=<value>]`
`@_<attr> <object>[=<value>]`
`ATTRIB_SET/<attr> <object>=<value>`

The `&<attr>` and `@_<attr>` commands can be used to set or clear an attribute from an object. When entered directly from a client, they do not evaluate the `<value>`.

ATTRIB_SET is the internal command which powers &attr and @_attr setting; it cannot be used directly, but can be restricted or @hook'd to change the behaviour of &attr/@_attr-setting.
