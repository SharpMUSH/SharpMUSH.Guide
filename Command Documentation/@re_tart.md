# @restart
`@restart <object>`
`@restart/all`

This command halts `<object>` (as described in @halt), and then triggers the STARTUP attribute on the object, if set. If `<object>` is a player, it affects the player and all of their objects. Players can use `@restart me` to restart their own objects. The `/all` switch halts all objects (see @allhalt) and restarts them, and can only be used by a wizard.
