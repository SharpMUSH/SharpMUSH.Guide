# move
`go[to] <direction>`
`go[to] home`
`move <direction>`
`move home`

Goes in the specified direction. `<Direction>` can be the name or alias of an exit in your area, the enter alias of an object in your area, or the leave alias of the object you are in. You do not need to use the word 'go' or 'move', in fact -- simply typing the direction will have the same effect.

'go home' is a special command that returns you to your home room/object.
