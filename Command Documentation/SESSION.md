# SESSION
`SESSION [<pattern>]`

The SESSION command is the same as the admin WHO, but instead of showing the hostname, it shows the number of bytes sent to, received from, and pending for each connection. `<pattern>` limits the output, only showing players whose name begins with `<pattern>`, or whose names or aliases match `<pattern>` if it's a wildcard pattern.
