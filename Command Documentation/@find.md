# @find
`@find [<name>][=<begin>, <end>]`

Displays the name and dbref of every room, thing, or player you control whose name matches `<name>`. If `<begin>` and `<end>` are given, @find will start at the `<begin>`th object in the database, and will not search past the `<end>`th object.

You may wish to use the @search command instead, which can filter the results more complexly.
