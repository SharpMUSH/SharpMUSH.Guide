# @quota
`@quota [<player>]`

These commands are only meaningful if the Quota system is enabled (check the use_quota @config option).

@quota shows the current quota for `<player>`, or for the executor if no `<player>` is given. You must control `<player>`, or have either the See_All or Quotas @power.

See [@quota2].
