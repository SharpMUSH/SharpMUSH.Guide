`look [<object>]`
`look <container>'s <object>`
`look <exit>'s <object>`
`look/outside [<object>]`

Displays the description of `<object>`, or the room you're in if you don't name a specific object. You can also look at objects inside others, as long as the `<container>` is not set OPAQUE, or at objects on the other side of an exit, if the exit is set TRANSPARENT or CLOUDY.

If you're inside a container, `look/outside` allows you to look at the room the container is in, or at other objects in your container's location, as long as your container is not set OPAQUE.

See [look2].
