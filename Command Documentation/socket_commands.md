# socket commands
These commands can only be entered through a client, on the connection they are typed into. They act on that connection rather than on a game object, so they work whether or not you have connected to a character, and would be meaningless if run by an object or from a queued action.

- IDLE
- INFO
- LOGOUT
- OUTPUTPREFIX
- OUTPUTSUFFIX
- PROMPT_NEWLINES
- QUIT
- SCREENWIDTH
- SCREENHEIGHT
- SOCKSET
- MSSP-REQUEST
- VERSION

PennMUSH handles these before it decides whether a descriptor has a player behind
it, and SharpMUSH does the same, which is why they answer at the connect screen
too. Because they act on the connection that typed them, a player with two
clients open sets the screen width of one without touching the other.

VERSION is a SharpMUSH addition: PennMUSH has only `@version`. It reports the
same lines that `@version` does and is accepted at the connect screen, because
players arriving from MUX-family servers and crawler bots type it unprefixed.

LOGOUT leaves your character but keeps the connection: you return to the screen
above and can connect again, as the same character or a different one, without
reconnecting. QUIT closes the connection instead. Logging out clears the
settings you made on that connection, so the next login on it starts clean.

In addition, the following commands can only be used at the login screen:

- cd
- ch
- cv
- connect
- create
- register

The WHO command can also be used at the login screen. Please note that this is different to the in-game WHO command. DOING and SESSION show that same login-screen listing when you are not connected, and their own in-game output once you are.
