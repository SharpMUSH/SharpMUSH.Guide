# @zemit
`@zemit[/silent|/noisy] <zone>=<message>`

Emits a message to all rooms in `<zone>`. You must have control `<zone>` in order to use this command.

The `/silent` switch suppresses the confirmation message, and `/noisy` causes it to be shown. With neither switch, the silent_pemit @config option determines whether or not the message is shown. The confirmation message is only shown if you are not in a room which would receive `<message>`.
