# @include2
@include takes the following switches to alter its behaviour:
- /nobreak: Prevents an @break/@assert in the included attribute from breaking the including action list.
- /localize: Saves all q-registers before including the attribute, and restores them after including the attribute.
- /clearregs: Clears all q-registers before including the attribute.
