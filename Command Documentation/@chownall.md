# @chownall
`@chownall[/preserve][/<types>] <player>[=<new owner>]`

This command @chowns all objects currently owned by `<player>` to the player `<new owner>`, or to the person running the command if no `<new owner>` is given. All the objects will have privileged flags and powers cleared, and be set halt, unless the `/preserve` switch is given.

If one or more of `/things`, `/rooms` or `/exits` are provided, only objects of the given types are chowned. Otherwise, all objects are chowned.

This command can only be used by Wizards.
