# brief
`brief[/opaque] [<object>]`

This command works like an abbreviated version of "examine", showing information about an object including its name, owner, zone, type, flags and powers, locks, channels, warnings, home and location. Unlike "examine", it does not print out all the attributes on the object. It will include the contents of `<object>`, unless the `/opaque` switch is given.

`<object>` defaults to "here".
