# @whereis
`@whereis <player>`

If `<player>` is not set UNFINDABLE, this command will tell you where the player is. It will also inform the player that you attempted to locate their position, and whether you succeeded or not.

To avoid being found this way, just do: `@set me=UNFINDABLE`

Example:
```
> @whereis Moonchilde
```
