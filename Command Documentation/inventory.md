# inventory
`inventory`

Lists what you are carrying. Can be abbreviated by just 'i', or 'inv'. It also tells you how much MUSH money you have. If you are not set OPAQUE, others will also be able to see what is in your inventory by looking at you.

Note that on some MUSHes it is possible to take things that are in someone else's inventory. To be safe, @lock any objects that you do not want to lose.
