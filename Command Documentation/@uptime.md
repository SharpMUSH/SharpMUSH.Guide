# @uptime
`@uptime[/mortal]`

This command, for mortals, gives the time until the next database dump. For wizards, it also gives the system uptime (just as if 'uptime' had been typed at the shell prompt) and process statistics, some of which are explained in the next help entry. Wizards can use the `/mortal` switch to avoid seeing the extra process statistics.

See [@uptime2].
