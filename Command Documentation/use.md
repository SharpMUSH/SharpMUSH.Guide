# use
`use <object>`

This command attempts to "use" `<object>`. If you do not pass `<object>`'s @lock/use, the UFAIL/OUFAIL/AUFAIL attributes are triggered.

If you pass the lock, you will see `<object>`'s USE attribute, and others in your location will see `<object>`'s OUSE. Depending on `<object>`'s CHARGES attribute, one of `<object>`'s AUSE or RUNOUT attributes will be triggered - see [@charges] for more information.
