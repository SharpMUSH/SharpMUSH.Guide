# LOGOUT
`LOGOUT`

LOGOUT is similar to QUIT, but instead of disconnecting you from the game completely, it merely disconnects you from your current character and returns you to the opening welcome screen. This is useful if you want to disconnect and then reconnect to another character. Unlike most commands, it is case-sensitive and must be typed in all caps.
