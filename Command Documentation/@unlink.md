# @unlink
`@unlink <exit>`
`@unlink <room>`

The first form of this command unlinks an exit from its destination room. Unlinked exits may be picked up and dropped elsewhere or relinked by anyone else. (Note that relinking an unlinked exit will @chown it to you if you do not already own it.)

The second form removes the DROP-TO on the room.
